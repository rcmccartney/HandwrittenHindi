# HandwrittenHindi
Use CNNs and MLPs to classify handwritten Hindi, using three datasets from 
http://lipitk.sourceforge.net/hpl-datasets.htm.

## Dependencies
The MLP runs in matlab without any dependencies, using code in part from the 
Coursera courses Machine Learning by Andrew Ng and Neural Networks and Machine
Learning by Geoffrey Hinton.

The CNN code requires MatConvNet from the Oxford VGG lab, located here:
